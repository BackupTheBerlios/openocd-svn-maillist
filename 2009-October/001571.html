 @section releasewhy Why Produce Releases?

+Distributors of patched versions of OpenOCD are encouraged to extend the
+version string with a unique version tag when producing external
+releases, as this helps to identify your particular distribution series.
+
+For example, the following command will add a 'foo1' tag to the
+configure.in script of a local copy of the source tree:
+
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at code</A>
+tools/release.sh version bump tag foo
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at endcode</A>
+
+This command will modify the configure.in script in your working copy
+only.  After running the @c bootstrap sequence, the tree can be patched
+and used to produce your own derived versions.  The same command can be
+used each time the derived package is released, incrementing the tag's
+version to facilitate tracking the changes you have distributed.

 The release process includes version number manipulations to the tree
 being released, ensuring that all numbers are incremented at the right
 time and in the proper locations of the repository.

    User's Guide updates
    
    Capture various bits of useful information that have come up on the
    list but haven't yet gotten into the documentation:
    
     - Watchdog timers firing during JTAG debug need attention;
    
     - Some chips have special registers to help JTAG debug;
    
     - Cortex-M3 stepping example with IRQs and maskisr;
    
     - Clarifications re adaptive clocking:  not all ARMs do it, and
       explain it a bit better.

+Watchog timers are typically used to automatically reset systems if
+some application task doesn't periodically reset the timer.  (The
+assumption is that the system has locked up if the task can't run.)
+When a JTAG debugger halts the system, that task won't be able to run
+and reset the timer ... potentially causing resets in the middle of
+your debug sessions.
+
+It's rarely a good idea to disable such watchdogs, since their usage
+needs to be debugged just like all other parts of your firmware.
+That might however be your only option.
+
+Look instead for chip-specific ways to stop the watchdog from counting
+while the system is in a debug halt state.  It may be simplest to set
+that non-counting mode in your debugger startup scripts.  You may however
+need a different approach when, for example, a motor could be physically
+damaged by firmware remaining inactive in a debug halt state.  That might
+involve a type of firmware mode where that &quot;non-counting&quot; mode is disabled

    NOR: add optional &quot;flash erase_address&quot; sector padding
    
    Add a NOR flash mechanism where erase_address ranges can be padded
    out to sector boundaries, triggering a diagnostic:
    
      &gt; flash erase_address 0x0001f980 16
      address range 0x0001f980 .. 0x0001f98f is not sector-aligned
      Command handler execution failed
      in procedure 'flash' called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 647
      called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 361
      &gt;
    
      &gt; flash erase_address pad 0x0001f980 16
      Adding extra erase range, 0x0001f800 to 0x0001f97f
      Adding extra erase range, 0x0001f990 to 0x0001fbff
      erased address 0x0001f980 (length 16) in 0.095975s (0.163 kb/s)
      &gt;
    
    This addresses what would otherwise be something of a functional
    regression.  An earlier version of the interface had a dangerous
    problem:  it would silently erase data outside the range it was
    told to erase.  Fixing that bug turned up some folk who relied on
    that unsafe behavior.  (The classic problem with interface bugs!)
    Now they can get that behavior again.  If they really need it,
    just specify &quot;pad&quot;.

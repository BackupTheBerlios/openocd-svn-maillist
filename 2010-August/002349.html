commit 7682877c8ca59226f7131db5fe35253acf117bb4

    xscale documentation: vector table handling
    
    Hi everyone.  I noticed some incorrect information in the user manual
    regarding how the vector table is handled on the xscale, so for your
    consideration, here's a short patch that corrects it, and adds a
    little more detail I thought might be helpful.
    
    The documentation states that OpenOCD does not attempt to synchronize
    the vector tables in memory with those stored in the &quot;mini instruction
    cache&quot;.  In fact, on each resume it does copy from memory to the cache
    all entries in the high and low tables that were not previously
    defined using the 'xscale vector_table' command. (In
    src/target/xscale.c, see xscale_update_vectors(), which is invoked by
    xscale_resume().)  I take advantage of this during Linux boot-up.  The
    extra detail describes in general terms how I do this.
    
    Corrections, comments are of course gratefully received.
    
    Thanks,
    Mike

+Alternatively, you may choose to keep some or all of the mini-IC
+vector table entries synced with those written to memory by your
+system software.  The mini-IC can not be modified while the processor
+is executing, but for each vector table entry not previously defined
+using the @code{xscale vector_table} command, OpenOCD will copy the
+value from memory to the mini-IC every time execution resumes from a
+halt.  This is done for both high and low vector tables (although the
+table not in use may not be mapped to valid memory, and in this case
+that copy operation will silently fail).  This means that you will
+need to briefly halt execution at some strategic point during system
+start-up; e.g., after the software has initialized the vector table,
+but before exceptions are enabled.  A breakpoint can be used to
+accomplish this once the appropriate location in the start-up code has
+been identified.  A watchpoint over the vector table region is helpful
+in finding the location if you're not sure.  Note that the same
+situation exists any time the vector table is modified by the system
+software.

 The debug handler must be placed somewhere in the address space using
 the @code{xscale debug_handler} command.  The allowed locations for the
 debug handler are either (0x800 - 0x1fef800) or (0xfe000800 -

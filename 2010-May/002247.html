commit 8465e9944291a03a216fa15e0d7ed6eb9d44ba92

    reset: fix reset halt bug
    
    I was finally able to figure out the cause of this problem.  There are two
    parts to the patch.  The first patch modifies the configuration file I
    originally generated for the Atmel AT91SAM9G20 board and achieves the
    following:
    
    +++ Splits the reset-init handler into a reset-start handler for some of the
    initial configuration activities and keeps the remainder in the reset-init
    handler as was the case before.  This was the real issue that was causing
    the timing problems I identified before.  This solution was confirmed with
    an o-scope on actual target hardware.
    
    +++ Adds a new instruction in the reset-start handler to disable fast memory
    accesses in the reset-start handler.  When the target jtag clock is started
    out at 2 kHz during system clock initialization, memory writes (i.e.
    register write to enable external reset pin -- basically to RSTC_MR) are
    naturally slow and cause GDB keep-alive issues (refer to PATCH 2/2 for
    additional fixes).
    
    +++ Modifies the configuration file to use srst_only reset action. The
    reset-start/reset-init handler split also now allows the correct behavior to
    be used in the configuration file (previously had to use both SRST and TRST
    even though only SRST is actually used and connected on the evaluation
    board).
    
    +++ Adds external NandFlash configuration support to take advantage of flash
    driver added earlier.  Doesn't fix any bugs but adds functionality that was
    marked as TBD before and thrown in when I did other work on the
    configuration file.

    target: slow targets could cause GDB to time out
    
    This second half of the patch is proposed to clean up some GDB keep alive
    issues on arm7_9 targets that start up with very slow clocks.  If an attempt
    is made to write to key registers on the processor with a slow jtag speed,
    GDB timeout warnings appear on the console (at least mine) when &quot;reset halt&quot;
    or &quot;reset init&quot; commands are issued from the gdb client:

    I added additional keep alive steps in areas that troubleshooting revealed
    were causing problems.  I only did this however for non-fast write memory
    accesses.  I don't think most people would be using fast memory accesses to
    write to memory when the jtag and system clocks are slow anyway.
    
    If you disagree with my feeling, think there is a more elegant way to handle
    the problem, or think the patch will cause other unforeseen problems with
    other targets, let me know.  As you can see below, the patch does eliminate
    the problem on my development station and I suspect that it will benefit
    others.

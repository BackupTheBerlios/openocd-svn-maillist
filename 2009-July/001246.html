+The OpenOCD maintainers should produce &lt;i&gt;releases&lt;/i&gt; periodically.  This
+section gives several reasons to explain the reasons for making releases
+on a regular basis.  These reasons lead to motivation for developing and
+following a set of &lt;i&gt;release processes&lt;/i&gt;.  The actual processes are
+described in the remainder of the @ref releases sections.

 At any time, a &quot;source archives&quot; can be produced by running 'make dist'
 in the OpenOCD project tree.  With the 0.2.0 release, this command will

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at section</A> releaseversions Release Versions
 
+The OpenOCD version string is composed of three numeric components
+separated by two decimal points: @c x.y.z, where @c x is the @a major
+version number, @c y is the @a minor number, and @c z is the @a micro.
+
+For a &lt;i&gt;bug-fix&lt;/i&gt; release, the micro version number will be non-zero
+(&lt;code&gt;z &gt; 0&lt;/code&gt;).  For a &lt;i&gt;minor release&lt;/i&gt;, the micro version
+number will be zero (&lt;code&gt;z = 0&lt;/code&gt;).  For a &lt;i&gt;major releases&lt;/i&gt;,
+the minor version will @a also be zero (&lt;code&gt;y = 0, z = 0&lt;/code&gt;).
+
+The trunk and all branches should have the tag '-in-development' in
+their version number.  This tag helps developers identify reports
+created from the Subversion repository, and it can be detected and
+manipulated by the release script.  Specifically, this tag will be
+removed and re-added during the release process; it should never be
+manipulated by developers in submitted patches.
+
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at subsection</A> releaseversionsdist Patched Versions
+
+Distributors of patched versions of OpenOCD are encouraged to extend
+the version string when producing external releases, as this helps to
+identify your particular distribution series.
+
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at subsection</A> releaseversionsdist Version Processes
+
+The release process includes version number manipulations to the tree
+being released, ensuring that all numbers are incremented at the right
+time and in the proper locations of the repository.
+
+The version numbers for any branch should monotonically
+increase to the next successive integer, except when reset to zero
+during major or minor releases.  The community should decide when
+major and minor milestones will be released.
+
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at section</A> releasewho Release Manager
+
 OpenOCD archive releases will be produced by an individual filling the
-role of &lt;i&gt;Release Manager&lt;/i&gt;.  This individual determines the schdule

-The OpenOCD release process must be carried out on a periodic basis
-in order to realize the benefits outlined above (@see releaseswhy).
+Each release requires one individual to fulfill the RM role; however,
+graceful transitions of this authority may take place at any time.  The
+current RM may transfer their authority to another contributor in a post
+to the OpenOCD development mailing list.  Such delegation of authority
+must be approved by the individual that will receive it and the
+community of maintainers.  Initial arrangements with the new RM should
+be made off-list, as not every contributor wants these responsibilities.
 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at subsection</A> releasewhowhat RM Responsibilities
+
+In addition to the actual process of producing the releases, the RM is
+responsible for keeping the community informed of all progress through
+the release cycle(s) being managed.  The RM is responsible for managing
+the changes to the package version, though the release tools should
+manage the tasks of adding or removing any required development branch

 Starting with the 0.2.0 release, the OpenOCD project should produce a
-new minor release each month, with a major release once per year.  Bug
-fix releases could be provided more frequently; however, these should
-not be a priority for the Release Manager until the processes have been
-fully automated, to use resources most efficiently.
+new minor release every month or two, with a major release once a year.
+Bug fix releases could be provided more frequently.  These release
+schedule goals may be adjusted in the future, after the project
+maintainers and distributors receive feedback and experience.
 
-If T is the time of the next release, then the following milestones
-describe the release milestones for each new release cycle.
+More importantly, the statements made in this section do not create an
+obligation by any member of the OpenOCD community to produce new
+releases on regular schedule, now or in the future.
 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at subsection</A> releasewhenexample Sample Schedule
+
+The RM must pro-actively communicate with the community from the
+beginning of the development cycle through the delivery of the new
+release.  This section presents guidelines for scheduling key points
+where the community must be informed of changing conditions.
+
+If T is the time of the next release, then the following schedule 
+might describe some of the key milestones of the new release cycle:
+
 - T minus one month: start of new development cycle
 - T minus two weeks: announce pending trunk closure to new work
 - T minus one week: close trunk to new work, begin testing phase
 - T minus two days: call for final bug fixes
 - T minus one day: produce -rc packages and distribute to testers
 - T minus one hour: produce final packages and post on-line
+- T minus zero: Announce the release to our mailing list and the world.
 
-The process of scheduling release milestones should be community driven,
-though the Release Manager should attempt to follow these guidelines.
-Specifically, missing features that were scheduled for a release should
-be dropped, rather than delaying the release cycle to wait for them.
+Some additional supplemental communication will be desirable.  The above
+list omits the step-by-step instructions to daily release management.
+Individuals performing release management need to have the ability to
+interact proactively with the community as a whole, anticipating when
+such interaction will be required and giving ample notification.
 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">- at section</A> releaseshow Release Process: Step-by-Step
+The next section explains why the OpenOCD project allows significant
+flexibility in the part of the development that precedes the release
+process.
 
-The exact process likely requires a few releases to work out the bugs,
-as it will take some experience before a script can be developed and
-tested that does everything safely and robustly.  Even then, some steps
-require clear user intervention -- and not only by the release manager.
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at note</A> The OpenOCD project does not presently produce -rc packages.  As
+such, the step suggested in the list above should be read as trying to
+stimulate others to test the project build and packaging on as many
+platforms as possible.  This proposition will be palatable once release
+management tools have been committed to the tree.
 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at subsection</A> releasewhenflex Schedule Flexibility
+
+The Release Manager should attempt to follow the guidelines in this
+document, but the process of scheduling each release milestone should be
+community driven at the start.  By the end, missing features that were
+scheduled for a release must be dropped by the Release Manager, rather
+than allowing the release cycle to be delayed while waiting for them.
+
+Despite any assurances this schedule may appear to give, the Release
+Manager cannot schedule the work that will be done on the project,
+when it will be submitted, review, and deemed suitable to be committed.
+In this way, the RM cannot act as a priest in a cathedral; OpenOCD uses
+the bazaar development model.  The release schedule must adapt
+continuously in response to changes in the rate of churn.
+
+In particular, the suggested period of &quot;one or two month&quot; reflects some
+expectation of a fairly high rate of development.  Fewer releases may be
+required if developers contribute less patches, and more releases may be
+desirable if the project continues to grow and experience high rates of
+community contribution.  During each cycle, the RM should be tracking
+the situation and gathering feedback from the community .
+
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at section</A> releasehow Release Process: Step-by-Step
+
+The release process may require a few iterations to work out any bugs.
+Even with the release script, some steps require clear user intervention
+-- and not only by the Release Manager.

-
-You need to download the libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2.tar.gz

-
-Copy the file libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2\include\usb.h

-
-Copy the library libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2\lib\gcc\libusb.a
-to your MinGW library directory.
-
-Take note that different Linux distros often have different
-MinGW installation directory. Some of them also put the
-library and include into a seperate sys-root directory.
-
-If there is a new svn version of libusb-win32, you can build it
-as well. 
-
-This is the instrunction from the libusb-win32 Makefile.
-# If you're cross-compiling and your mingw32 tools are called
-# i586-mingw32msvc-gcc and so on, then you can compile libusb-win32
-# by running
-#    make host_prefix=i586-mingw32msvc all

-It does not provide Windows binary. You can build it from the

-
-If you are using the git tree, the following is the instruction 
-from README.mingw. You need to have cmake installed.
-- Edit Toolchain-mingw32.cmake to point to the correct MinGW 
-installation.
-- Create a build directory like &quot;mkdir build-win32&quot;, e.g in ../libftdi/
-- cd in that directory and run  
-  &quot;cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake ..&quot;
-- Copy src/ftdi.h to your MinGW include directory.
-- Copy build-win32/src/*.a to your MinGW lib directory.

+libftdi
+-------
+
+The author does not provide Windows binary. You can build it from a
+released source tarball or the git tree.
+
+If you are using the git tree, the following are the instructions from
+README.mingw. You will need to have the cmake utility installed.
+
+- Edit Toolchain-mingw32.cmake to point to the correct MinGW 
+  installation.

+- Copy src/ftdi.h to your MinGW include directory.
+- Copy build-win32/src/*.a to your MinGW lib directory.
+
+libftd2xx
+---------
+
+The Cygwin/Win32 ZIP file contains a directory named ftd2xx.win32.
+After being extracted, the directory does not need further preparation.
+Instead, its path must be provided to the --with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir
+configure option, as shown in the next section.
+
+OpenOCD
+-------
+
+Now you can build OpenOCD under Linux using MinGW.  You need to use
+--build and --host configure options.
+
+To use libftdi:
+
+  ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc \
+        --enable-ft2232_libftdi \
+        ... other options ...
+
+To use ftd2xx:
+
+  ./configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=i586-mingw32msvc \
+        --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx \
+        --with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir=/path/to/libftd2xx-win32 \
+        ... other options ...
+
+If you are using the SVN repository, see the README file for additional
+instructions about configuring and building OpenOCD.

OpenOCD 0.1.0 release (approximate)

SVN 1355 seems to be the magic point, this is the closest we have in git.

      allows launching OpenOCD w/telnet+gdb server w/the
      allows launching OpenOCD w/telnet+gdb server w/the
      A dummy driver to test codepath w/no contact w/target.
      More robust handling of unknown target state for step/continue packet.
      TRST is asserted *before* target-&gt;type-&gt;assert_reset() is invoked. Removed old code.
      Added a few tweaks while playing with texi.
      moved out stuff that wasn't already moved from openocd.pdf to the target library.
      retired fast_memory_access. It's always fast now.
      target read/write is no longer attempted for target_xxx() functions when the target has not been examined(fails w/error).
      Added checks for target-&gt;type-&gt;read/write_memory, soft_reset_halt and run_algorithm that the target has been examined.
      - sw_bkpts fails if the target is not halted. The side effect is
      fix SEGFAULT regression in cortex after TRST fixes
      Edgar Grimberg added some missing scripts from the install
      Update Embedded ICE registers explicitly during target-&gt;type-&gt;examine() instead
      fix for gaffe in  555 that stopped JTAG chain examine + validate from running.
      Edwin Olsen: improves breakpoint handling on cortex-m3 parts. Specifically, this patch allows expressions to be evaluated in GDB that contain function calls.
      Nicolas Pitre fixed regression.
      Enabled auto erase, gdb memory map and gdb flash programming by default.
      retired auto_erase, added optional erase arg to flash write_image.
      Karl RobinSod &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">karl.robinsod at gmail.com</A>&gt; added lpc288x support. Some work remaining, committing for test/collaboration purposes.
      deleted obsolete stuff.
      wip on reporting bugs.
      Andre Renaud support for the am29sl800db CFI flash chip (id: 0x0004, 0x226b).
      added fast option.
      fixed doc for GDB memory map and flash program defaults to follow code
      Tim Hudson: removed setting jtag_speed directly (which should not be done).
      regions outside flash are now read/write nocache by default. GDB 6.8 would mark non-flash areas as inacessible by default.
      Tim Hudson contributed at91sam9260 target config files + some interface definitions.
      Pavel Chromy's on chip flash loader
      Edgar's new test cases.
      Edgar's new test cases.
      Close dangling file handle
      make debug_level 3 useful again... the log just drowns. perhaps introduce debug_level 4?
      wip instructions for building Cortex toolchain

      now compiles again.
      Tim Hudson worked on English language.
      add missing reset script
      The target library is now the authorotative source of config examples
      Edgar Grimberg found tiny memory leak
      increase packet size to 16kBytes. Very slightly faster.
      Edgar Grimberg plugged a leak found w/Valgrind.
      This matters for embedded devices, but is probably not observably better for PC hosted OpenOCD.
      print available memory in log_level 3
      disable code that prints available mem under windows. Does not compile.
      Michael Fischer spotted a problem in the reset routines for srst_pulls_trst. It is a bit of a mystery why this was only visible w/LPC2148.
      printing available memory fails on win + mac. Disable for now until a robust way of doing this can be found.
      added stack trace.
      updated guidelines.
      Michael Fischer found and Edgar Grimberg fixed generic crash in timers reproduceable with at91fr40008
      fix mode output when illegal arm mode is detected. Now prints illegal mode for index -1.
      Michael Fischer found this bogus warning. Fixed.
      print out an error if srst_pulls_trst is not specified for
      Fix crash when mode number fetched from the target is invalid.
      reverted change in 658 and simply removed the busted warning for now.
      Edgar Grimberg fixes some memory handling issues and
      moved srst_pulls_trst check into arm7_9_common.c. Not tested yet, if it is broken it should &quot;only&quot; print bogus warnings or not print a warning when it should have.
      comment.
      jtag_exexcute_queue() now logs error when it is invoked before 'init' command.
      clock 1/0 in idle now configurable.
      found out why str912 reset halt failed.
      Fredrik Hederstierna: fix leak + clean up return codes
      Fredrik Hederstierna: fix leak + clean up return codes
      Pavel Chromy: fix logging syntax error + formatting &amp; removing obsolete comments.
      Pavel Chromy: TCK returns to zero before state of reset line is changed.
      Nicolas Pitre: Feroceon fixes
      GDB timeout fix. If a script takes a long time and does not produce any output, ping between every command.
      fallback for no implementation of multi word CFI write. Successful codepath not affected.
      Spen spotted a bug in warning for missing srst_pulls_trst
      Pavel Chromy: TAP state changed to TLR when SRST goes active with srst_pulls_trst, as in all other drivers
      Pavel Chromy:
      Pavel Chromy:
      added pre/post_reset scripts based on Pieter Conradie's ideas.
      Fixed bogus error message and plugged memory leak for the case when there was no reset script.
      David Anders: fixes an issue with large block nand flash address where the beginning of the OOB area is always selected instead of the beginning of a page when needed
      committing to reduce patch size for Tcl experiments. Not in use currently.
      David Anders more target lib scripts contributed by
      export find_file function
      hooks to enable experimentation with scripting language support. Reduces patch size, but has no effect on OpenOCD otherwise.
      wip
      wip.
      Jim Tcl support added
      Valentin Longchamp target script for mx31.cfg
      ARM11 update. OpenOCD supports starting without being able to talk to the hardware.

      Duane Ellis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">openocd at duaneellis.com</A>&gt;: This simple patch adds precision support to JIM's format command.
      more tcl cleanup.
      reset event is synonym for post_reset event.
      * src/jim.c: remove bogus return value from if {[expr]} {xx} when
      tcl regression fixes.
      added flash_banks low level command.
      &quot;flash banks&quot; is now implemented in Tcl on top of &quot;flash_banks&quot;. openocd_throw prefix is no longer required when executing OpenOCD commands from tcl.

      startup.tcl (former commands.tcl) is now embedded into OpenOCD executable.
      working notes.
      .cfg files are now executed as Jim Tcl. Commands that terminate script w/error message.
      - retired variable stuff.
      work in progress to improve help
      tcl_help prettier output.
      Charles Hardin ckhardin at gmail.com

      Charles Hardin &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">ckhardin at gmail.com</A>&gt;
      feeble beginnings for tcl api rules.
      better error messages for target event scripts.
      print syntax for command upon syntax error.

      1. GDB will print cryptic error messages if it is not fed keep-alive packets
      keep_alive() fix for reset warnings.
      resume is now asynchronous
      &quot;reset&quot; without arguments now execute a &quot;reset run&quot;.
      remove obsolete reset_mode
      This allows overriding builtin openocd commands.
      daemon_startup is now retired in favour of adding &quot;init&quot; and &quot;reset halt/init/run&quot; to the end of the config file/openocd command line.
      clarify error message w.r.t. not being able to set breakpoint
      throw exception upon syntax error.
      <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">openocd at duaneellis.com</A> fix naming confusion. Use ocd_ prefix for ocd API consistently.
      Duane Ellis &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">openocd at duaneellis.com</A>&gt;
      Ben Bodley &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">ben at teknique.com</A>&gt;  non-CFI compliant flash (AMIC A29L800A)

      use reset init explicitly before &quot;load&quot;.
      cross compile fix
      - jtag_khz/speed are now single parameter only. These are used
      update jtag_speed/khz docs a bit.
      jim license cleanup
      Allows config scripts to override handling of 'R'(restart) GDB packet.
      restart is a per-target action

      retire daemon_startup
      take path to eCos files from environment variable
      more error message cleanup. invalid args &amp; syntax errors both now print arguments of command.
      OpenOCD commands w/prefix ocd_ now set the primary Tcl return value instead of messing with ocd_output local variable. Much more straightforward and expected behaviour. The side effect is that the ocd_xxx commands will print output twice(once immediately and once upon completion of command). This is a strange, expected and intentional behaviour.
      added yours sincerely for files where I feel that I've made non-trivial contributions.
      minimum address and maximum length argument to load_image. Used in lieu of reset init script when executable w/reset init sequence is available.
      add check for target_read/write_buffer 32 bit wrap.

      wait up to 1 second for halted state upon reset init/halt.
      The reset routine now works w/LPC2148 out of the box.
      TAP_TLR won't work in a pathmove sequence. OpenOCD shouldn't and doesn't need to support this.
      moves handling of problems with resetting into the halted state
      define resetting the target into the halted or running
      halting srst_pulls_trst targets is now snappier and has explicit warning.
      Duane Ellis: fix warnings
      gaffe in previous commit fixed. &quot;reset run&quot; now works again for arm7/9
      GDB monitor commands now also get halted state upon e.g. &quot;reset halt&quot;.
      lpc2148 2MHz, RCLK and clockless config script versions

      fixed error handling in flash bank.
      fix comment w.r.t. start address for RAM
      tinker with Xscale performance. Poll a bit more before sleeping.
      duane ellis: (A) a new concept called &quot;Name Value Pair&quot; or NVP, in simple terms: Think: &quot;String&quot; and &quot;Value&quot;. There can be many strings - all related to a single value, for examle: &quot;T&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, all can represent &quot;truth&quot;, the reverse mapping is more simplistic - the first matching number wins.
      tinker with Xscale performance, anti-log spamming is now only for debug_level 3 or more. Otherwise polling is done continously for 1 second.
      added alive_sleep() function to let GDB alive packets be sent
      use alive_sleep() from sleep command
      added some alive_sleep()'s
      DANGER: committed work-in-progress to handle examination of jtag devices without IDCODE. I think this works, but I may have to pull that change out again...
      search and replace usleep(1000) with alive_sleep(1) to avoid GDB timeouts.
      better polling debug_level 3 handling
      make target_wait_state() usable from other places, made LOG_USER() output LOG_DEBUG() output. Avoids flooding logs in certain cases and OpenOCD will output error message if the halt fails.
      switch to alive_sleep() to avoid gdb timeouts
      fixed warning
      duane ellis: fix warning
      fix BUG: keep_alive() error messages
      Daniel Gimpelevich fix reset halt on feroceon

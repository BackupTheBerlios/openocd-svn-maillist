<PRE>This is an automated email from the git hooks/post-receive script. It was
generated because a ref change was pushed to the repository containing
the project &quot;Main OpenOCD repository&quot;.

The branch, master has been updated
       via  1c51f342d7f6da760ddd4e46eae91b6d6c06f579 (commit)
      from  333601da4bbe2bf39ccc21ddc5160344ca953678 (commit)

Those revisions listed above that are new to this repository have
not appeared on any other notification email; so we list those

    Tweak release docs
    
    Contrast releases to git snapshot tarballs.  Mention that
    releases have some quality-improvement focus, with special
    non-&quot;dev&quot; version IDs.  Explain more about version IDs,
    using &quot;openocd -v&quot; to see them, etc;
    
    Make release milestone info be less specific about timing,
    and presume we have both a merge window and an RC stage.
    
    Rework the release process information to match reality a
    bit more closely.  Reference the version.sh script (in one
    place the wrong script was referenced).  Bugfix branches
    get special treatment, while non-bugfix releases are more
    or less what *defines* being the mainline branch.

 The OpenOCD version string is composed of three numeric components
 separated by two decimal points: @c x.y.z, where @c x is the @a major
 version number, @c y is the @a minor number, and @c z is the @a micro.
-

+For any &lt;em&gt;bug-fix&lt;/em&gt; release, the micro version number will be non-zero

 number will be zero (&lt;code&gt;z = 0&lt;/code&gt;).  For a &lt;i&gt;major releases&lt;/i&gt;,
 the minor version will @a also be zero (&lt;code&gt;y = 0, z = 0&lt;/code&gt;).

-After these required numeric components, the version string may contain
-one or more &lt;i&gt;version tags&lt;/i&gt;, such as '-rc1' or '-dev'.
+After these required numeric components, release version strings
+may contain tags such as as &lt;em&gt;-rc1&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-rc2&lt;/em&gt;.
+These 'rc' tags indicate &quot;release candidate&quot; versions of the package.
+Like the major/minor/micro numbers, these tags will be manipulated

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-svn">+ at subsubsection</A> releaseversionsdist Packager Versions
 
 Distributors of patched versions of OpenOCD are encouraged to extend the
 version string with a unique version tag when producing external
 releases, as this helps to identify your particular distribution series.
+Knowing that a release has such patches can be essential to tracking
+down and fixing bugs.
 
-For example, the following command will add a 'foo1' tag to the
-configure.in script of a local copy of the source tree:
+Packager version tags should always be suffixes to the version
+code from the OpenOCD project, signifying modifications to the
+original code base.  Each packager release should have a unique
+version.
+
+For example, the following command will add a 'foo' tag to the
+configure.in script of a local copy of the source tree, giving
+a version label like &lt;em&gt;0.3.0-foo&lt;/em&gt;:
 
 @code
-tools/release.sh version bump tag foo
+tools/release/version.sh version tag add foo
 @endcode
 
 This command will modify the configure.in script in your working copy
 only.  After running the @c bootstrap sequence, the tree can be patched
-and used to produce your own derived versions.  The same command can be
-used each time the derived package is released, incrementing the tag's
+and used to produce your own derived versions.  You might check that
+change into a private branch of your git tree, along with the other
+patches you are providing.
+
+You can also &quot;bump&quot; those tags (so &quot;foo1&quot; becomes &quot;foo2&quot; etc)
+each time a derived package is released, incrementing the tag's
 version to facilitate tracking the changes you have distributed.
